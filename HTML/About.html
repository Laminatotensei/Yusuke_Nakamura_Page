            Over his 15 years as a professional illustrator, Yusuke Nakamura (中村佑介 Nakamura
            Yusūke) has worked on dozens of projects, creating pictures for book covers, 
            postcards, calendars, and even candy packaging. Outside of Japan, he’s best known as 
            the artist behind J-rock group Asian Kung-Fu Generation’s iconic album covers, and as 
            a character designer for <i>The Tatami Galaxy</i> and <i>The Night Is Short</i>, Walk On Girl.

            <p class="text-black">
                During his first years at Osaka University of Arts, Yusuke Nakamura struggled to form 
                his own artistic identity. His early pieces were simplistic in terms of color and 
                composition and usually featured young Japanese women, a nod to his main 
                influences, Yumeji Takehisa and Seiichi Hayashi. Both artists specialized in creating 
                bijin-ga (美人画), or pictures of beautiful women.

            <br>
            <p class="text-black">
                However, like any other trend, traditional bijin-ga had long gone out of style by 
                Nakamura’s college enrollment. His plain girls and black-and-white palette were a far 
                cry from what was popular among his peers. At the suggestion of his classmates, he 
                decided to look elsewhere for inspiration.
                <br><br>
                In time, he came across the work of Norman Rockwell, the famous American painter. 
                When he studied Rockwell’s pictures, Nakamura realized each one told a hidden story 
                that couldn’t be seen in just a quick glance. Small details that seemed unimportant at 
                first hinted at something bigger going on behind the scenes.
                <br><br>
                Nakamura was absolutely blown away. As a design student, he always thought strictly 
                following the elements and principles of design were what made pictures great. But 
                Rockwell’s work wasn’t powerful because of its technical achievements, but because of 
                its striking approach to visual storytelling.                
            </p>

            <br>
            <p class="text-black">
                Nakamura’s art went through a dramatic shift soon after. Taking cues from Rockwell, 
                he brought new personality to his illustrations, pulling his subjects out of their 
                static scenes and into more dynamic situations.
                <br><br>
                Gone too were the monochromatic color schemes, gradually replaced by bolder hues 
                meant to evoke emotion. As Nakamura explained in his lecture, he’s a true believer in 
                color psychology. Smart designers know how color choice influences both the feel of a 
                picture and the person viewing it. By taking the time to study color theory, Nakamura 
                added another emotional dimension to his artwork.
                <br><br>
                Other thematic elements quickly worked their way to become Nakamura’s hallmarks. 
                His collaged use of organic and geometric shapes, particularly motifs taken from 
                Japanese culture, can be found throughout his illustrations. Symbolism plays a part as 
                well. Nakamura is fond of using animals to represent abstract ideas of people, places, 
                or other things.                
            </p>

                By the time Yusuke Nakamura finished college in 2000, he already had some 
                commercial illustration work under his belt, mostly projects for student clubs and 
                local events. His big break came in 2002 when up-and-coming musical groups 
                Gentouki and Asian Kung-Fu Generation both tapped him to design album artwork for 
                their CDs. Nakamura still collaborates with both bands to this day.
                <br><br>
                After his debut, things really got rolling. From 2005 to 2012, Nakamura worked as art 
                director for Shogakukan’s Qui! La! La! literary magazine. His original character Kirara-chan, 
                a charming idol-like girl, graced many of the publication’s covers during his tenure.

            <p class="text-black">
                In 2010, anime film director Masaaki Yuasa approached Nakamura to design the lead 
                characters for his upcoming series, The Tatami Galaxy. Inspired by Nakamura’s 
                illustrations for the original Tomihiko Morimi novel, Yuasa felt the artist’s retro-cool 
                style paired nicely with his own aesthetic vision for the show. The duo would later 
                work together again for Yuasa’s feature film, <i><u>The Night Is Short, Walk On Girl</u></i>.
                <br><br>
                In between his larger projects, Yusuke Nakamura has worked on many other creative 
                assignments. He’s illustrated textbooks for Japanese high school programs, designed 
                packaging for sweets, including <i><u>Choco Pies</u></i>, and most recently partnered with 
                Turner Color Works to produce <i><u>a new line of acrylic gouache paints</u></i>.

                No matter the commission or client, Yusuke Nakamura makes sure his work stays true 
                to his artistic vision. He currently dubs his style as “modern Japonism” — nostalgic 
                imagery executed with a forward-thinking approach. His work is all about finding the 
                balance between the new and the old. That’s why, among bright colors and intricate 
                linework, you’ll almost always find elegant girls as his subjects, a throwback to his 
                bijin-ga days.
